Connect Claude Desktop to MCP Server Triggers hosted on your n8n instances!

## Overview

This extension allows Claude Desktop to connect to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that are running as webhook triggers on n8n. Once connected, all tools exposed by your n8n MCP servers become available in Claude.

## Features

- üîå Connect to multiple n8n MCP Server Triggers
- üîê Support for various authentication methods (Basic, Bearer, API Key)
- üõ†Ô∏è Automatic tool discovery and registration
- üìä Connection status monitoring
- ‚ö° Real-time tool execution
- üîÑ Automatic reconnection handling

## Installation

1. Download `n8n-mcp-connector.dxt` from the [releases page](https://github.com/shalalalaw/n8n-mcp-connector/releases)
2. Open Claude Desktop
3. Go to **Extensions** ‚Üí **Install Extension**
4. Select the downloaded `.dxt` file
5. Configure your n8n MCP server endpoints

## Setting up MCP Server Triggers in n8n

Before using this extension, you need to set up MCP Server Triggers in your n8n instances:

1. Create a new workflow in n8n
2. Add a **Webhook** trigger node
3. Configure it to handle MCP protocol requests
4. Add your MCP tool logic in subsequent nodes
5. Activate the workflow and copy the webhook URL

Example n8n webhook configuration:
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Path**: `/mcp-server` (or your preferred path)
- **Response Mode**: "When last node finishes"
- **Response Data**: "Last node's data"

## Configuration

When you install the extension, you'll be prompted to add your n8n MCP server endpoints:

### Endpoint Configuration

- **Name**: A friendly identifier (e.g., "production-tools", "dev-mcp")
- **URL**: The full webhook URL from n8n (e.g., `https://n8n.mysite.com/webhook/abc123/mcp-server`)
- **Authentication Type**:
  - **None**: No authentication required
  - **Basic Auth**: Username and password
  - **Bearer Token**: JWT or OAuth token
  - **API Key**: Custom API key header
- **Timeout**: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "production-tools",
  "url": "https://n8n.company.com/webhook/prod-mcp-server",
  "auth_type": "bearer",
  "auth_value": "your-bearer-token",
  "timeout": 30
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, your n8n MCP tools will appear in Claude with the server name as a prefix:

- If your MCP server "production-tools" exposes a tool called "get_data"
- It will appear in Claude as "get_data (production-tools)"

You can then use these tools naturally in conversation:
- "Use the production tools to get the latest data"
- "Call the dev-mcp server to test the new feature"

## Security Considerations

- Credentials are stored securely in Claude Desktop's encrypted storage
- All connections use HTTPS
- Authentication headers are only sent to configured endpoints
- Each MCP server connection is isolated

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shalalalaw/n8n-mcp-connector
cd n8n-mcp-connector

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the extension
npm run build

# Create .dxt package
npm run package
```

## Development

```bash
# Run in watch mode
npm run dev

# Test connections
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed
- Verify the webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the n8n workflow is active
- Ensure authentication credentials are correct
- Test the webhook manually with curl or Postman

### Tools Not Appearing
- Check that your n8n MCP server implements the `tools/list` method
- Verify the response format matches MCP protocol specification
- Use the "Test All Connections" option from the extension menu

### Authentication Issues
- For Basic Auth: Ensure both username and password are provided
- For Bearer Token: Include only the token, not the "Bearer" prefix
- For API Key: Verify the correct header name with your n8n setup
